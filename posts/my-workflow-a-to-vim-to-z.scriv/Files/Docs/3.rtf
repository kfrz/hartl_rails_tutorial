\f0\fs28 \cf0 Many of us struggle with the sheer immensity of choices to make when it comes to our software and workflow. There are critics and cynics, but I pay them no mind. It\'92s important to remember the tools are only as good as the wielder, yet it is equally important to choose reliable tools. I\'92ve been in his boat, for far too long. It\'92s been nearly a decade. Finally, I\'92m comfortable. The key here, I think is comfort. I will parlay to you my terminal-based workflow, from which I produce all, but not limiting to, the following: live and studio recording, professional Wordpress themes, Ruby on Rails applications, JavaScript plugins, blog posts, invoices, and everything requisite to run a business from your keyboard. I\'92m aiming to be a digital nomad, free from the man and accepting my duty as a citizen of a free nation to live as I can dream. My tools will be important, will you help me see different perspectives by providing your opinions below? }
