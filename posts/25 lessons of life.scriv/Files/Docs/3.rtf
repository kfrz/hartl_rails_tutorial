\f0\fs28 \cf0 I\'92ve lived twenty four years and change on Earth as Keifer. Overall, I\'92m faring well. I\'92m a white male in my mid twenties, in the United States. I\'92ve got a reasonably comfortable lifestyle, my vices are those of the povert, occluding escapisms to pass the time. Music is my crush and computers are my best friend. They\'92re not judgmental. They do the things you tell them to, and more often than not, they do it well. Human interaction is frequent enough, mostly hampering my indignant narcissism, disallowing for the solitude requisite of peak creation. Where does it all end? Ascent or descent? Are the minds we will have through travelled simply homes for which to recall, or perhaps shells, to contain an essence of conscious being, that will never again exist? }
